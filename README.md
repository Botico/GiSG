# GiSG
Creates bash and batch install scripts for go programs

## Installing
Install GiSG by running the shell script for your os. This will provide you with an executable. Move it to your path and your ready to go!

## Running
To run and create your own scripts, run gisg in the directory that houses your main go file. Fill out the questions and it will generate your files for you.

## Foregn Languages
There are two reasons GiSG is called GiSG. See acro.txt for the first reason. The second reason is that it is Gaelic for fish. Fish can overcome the odds, like swimming up a water fall, like how GiSG can overcome the odds of installing smoothly on windows (also mac and linux, but mainly windows).
